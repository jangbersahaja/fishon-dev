## Next Steps (Phase 2)

As outlined in `plan-angler-dashboard.md`:

1. **Profile Management** (Week 3-4):

   - Edit personal information
   - Upload profile photo
   - Manage address
   - Emergency contact form
   - Profile completion indicator

2. **Favorites System** (Week 3-4):

   - Quick book from favorites
   - Private notes

3. **Reviews & Enhanced Features** (Week 5-6):

   - PDF receipt generation
   - Support contact form

4. **Advanced Features** (Future):

   - Email notifications
   - Trip management pages

## Known Limitations

- Favorites feature not yet implemented (placeholder page exists)
- Profile editing limited to view-only (Phase 2)
- No PDF receipt generation yet (Phase 3)
- No review system yet (Phase 3)
- Cancel booking uses existing API (no new cancellation flow)

## Dependencies Added

```json
{
  "@radix-ui/react-slot": "^1.1.x",
  "class-variance-authority": "^0.7.x",
  "clsx": "^2.1.x",
  "tailwind-merge": "^2.x"
}
```

## Environment Variables

No new environment variables required. Uses existing:

- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection
- Auth configuration (NextAuth)

## Performance Notes

- Server-side rendering for initial page loads
- Client-side filtering for bookings list
- Optimistic UI updates not yet implemented
- No caching strategy implemented (ISR recommended for Phase 2)

## Documentation

- Main plan: `docs/plan-angler-dashboard.md`
- This implementation doc: `docs/feature-angler-dashboard-phase1.md`

## Success Metrics to Track (Post-Launch)

- Dashboard adoption rate (% of users visiting within 7 days of booking)
- Booking status check frequency
- Time to payment completion
- Support ticket volume (should decrease)
- User retention (repeat bookings from dashboard)

## Conclusion

Phase 1 successfully delivers the core dashboard functionality outlined in the plan. All essential booking management features are in place, providing anglers with a professional, trust-building interface to manage their fishing charter bookings.

The implementation follows Next.js 15 best practices with:

- Server Components for data fetching
- Client Components only where needed (search, filters)
- Type-safe database queries
- Proper authentication guards
- Mobile-first responsive design

Phase 2 can now proceed with profile management and favorites system, building on this solid foundation.
