# Angler Dashboard - Strategic Plan (Revised)

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to build a professional, trust-building angler dashboard for fishon-market. The dashboard will serve as the central hub for anglers to manage their profiles, bookings, and interactions with captains.

**Current State (Post-Restructure):**
- ✅ Route groups architecture in place (`(auth)`, `(dashboard)`, `(marketplace)`, `(marketing)`)
- ✅ Booking flow pages: `/book/[charterId]` (form), `/book/confirm` (confirmation), `/book/payment/[bookingId]` (payment)
- ✅ Component organization (feature-based folders)
- ⚠️ Empty `(dashboard)` route group - ready for implementation
- ⚠️ Basic user authentication with NextAuth (Google OAuth + credentials)

**Proposed:** Full-featured dashboard leveraging existing booking pages, with profile management, booking history, reviews, favorites, and support

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals

1. **Build Trust**: Transparent booking management, clear status updates, and captain communication
2. **Increase Conversion**: Easy access to favorites and past charters for repeat bookings
3. **Reduce Support Burden**: Self-service profile management and clear booking information
4. **Encourage Reviews**: Seamless review flow after completed trips builds marketplace credibility

### Success Metrics

- **Engagement**: % of users who access dashboard within 7 days of booking
- **Retention**: Repeat booking rate from dashboard
- **Review Coverage**: % of PAID bookings that receive reviews
- **Support Reduction**: Decrease in booking status inquiries
- **Profile Completeness**: % of users with complete profiles (phone, address)

## Proposed Dashboard Structure

### URL Structure (Aligned with Route Groups)

```
# Dashboard Route Group: app/(dashboard)/account/
/account                       → Dashboard layout + redirect to /account/overview
/account/overview              → Dashboard home (summary cards, quick stats)
/account/profile               → Profile management
/account/bookings              → All bookings list with filters
/account/bookings/[id]         → Booking detail page
/account/favorites             → Saved charters
/account/support               → Help center & contact

# Existing Marketplace Routes (already implemented):
/book/[charterId]              → Booking form (trip selection, date, guests)
/book/confirm                  → Booking confirmation page
/book/payment/[bookingId]      → Payment page (Senang Pay integration - planned)

# Future Expansion (Phase 2+):
/account/profile/security      → Password & 2FA settings
/account/profile/preferences   → Notification preferences
/account/trips                 → Confirmed trips (PAID status filter)
/account/trips/upcoming        → Future trips only
/account/trips/past            → Completed trips with review prompts
```

**Key Architecture Notes:**
- Dashboard pages live in `app/(dashboard)/account/`
- Shared dashboard layout: `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
- Booking flow stays in `app/(marketplace)/book/`
- Components organized in `src/components/account/`
- Services in `src/lib/services/booking-service.ts` (create new)

## Security Considerations

### Data Access Controls

- Users can only access their own data
- Server-side session validation on every request
- Row-level security checks in database queries

### Privacy

- Email/phone only visible to captains after payment
- Address only shared with confirmed bookings
- Review anonymity option
- GDPR-compliant data export/deletion

### Payment Security

- PCI DSS compliance (when payment integrated)
- No credit card storage on our servers
- Secure payment gateway integration
- Receipt encryption

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

- Static: Profile page structure
- ISR: Booking list (revalidate every 60s)
- Client: Favorites list (React Query)
- CDN: Profile photos, receipts

### Loading States

- Skeleton screens for lists
- Optimistic updates for favorites
- Progressive image loading
- Lazy load past trips

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Breakpoints

- Mobile: < 640px
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px

### Mobile-First Features

- Bottom navigation (mobile)
- Swipe gestures for status filters
- Pull-to-refresh
- Native share integration
- Add to calendar

## Analytics & Tracking

### Key Events to Track

- Dashboard view
- Profile completion rate
- Booking status checks
- Favorite additions
- Review submissions
- Support contact attempts
- Payment initiations

### Conversion Funnels

1. Dashboard → Browse → Book
2. Trip complete → Review submit
3. Past trip → Rebook
4. Favorite → Book

## Migration Strategy

### Existing State After Restructure

✅ **Already Completed:**
- Route groups architecture (`(auth)`, `(dashboard)`, `(marketplace)`, `(marketing)`)
- Booking flow pages: `/book/[charterId]`, `/book/confirm`, `/book/payment/[bookingId]`
- Component organization (feature-based folders)
- Authentication with NextAuth (Google OAuth + credentials)
- Database schema with User and Booking models

⚠️ **Needs Migration:**
- Empty `(dashboard)` route group → needs account pages
- No existing `/account` or `/mybooking` pages to migrate
- Fresh start with clean architecture

### Rollout Strategy

**Beta Testing:**
1. Enable dashboard for test users first
2. Gather feedback on UX/UI
3. Iterate on design and functionality
4. Fix bugs before public launch

**Public Launch:**
1. Announcement email to all users
2. In-app tutorial/walkthrough
3. Blog post explaining new features
4. Monitor analytics and support tickets

**Metrics to Track:**
- Dashboard adoption rate
- Booking completion rate
- Profile completion rate
- Review submission rate
- Support ticket volume (should decrease)

### Data Migration

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All new fields are nullable
- Existing User and Booking models remain compatible
- No data migration required
- Backward compatible with existing auth flow

### Rollback Plan

**If Issues Arise:**
1. Feature flag to disable dashboard
2. Redirect `/account/*` to old placeholder page
3. Investigate and fix issues
4. Re-enable dashboard

**Monitoring:**
- Sentry error tracking
- Vercel Analytics for page performance
- User feedback form on dashboard

The phased approach allows us to launch an MVP quickly while planning for long-term feature expansion based on user feedback and analytics.

**Next Steps:**

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Create detailed UI mockups

4. Begin database schema migrations
5. Develop component library
6. Implement dashboard shell
7. Roll out features incrementally
8. Gather user feedback
9. Iterate and improve

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. Should we implement payment gateway in Phase 1 or Phase 2?
2. Do we want social login (Facebook, Apple) on profile page?
3. Should favorites be public or private?
4. What's the review moderation workflow?
5. Do we need booking insurance/protection plans?

---

## Revised Implementation Summary

### Key Changes from Original Plan

1. **Leverages Existing Booking Flow**: No need to rebuild `/book/[charterId]`, `/book/confirm`, or `/book/payment/[bookingId]` - they already exist
2. **Follows Route Groups Architecture**: Dashboard lives in `app/(dashboard)/account/`, consistent with restructured app
3. **Component Reuse**: Maximizes use of existing charter components (`CharterGallery`, `CaptainCard`, `AmenitiesCard`)
4. **Clean Separation**: Marketplace (public) vs Dashboard (authenticated) with clear boundaries
5. **Phased Approach**: 4 phases over 6+ weeks, starting with core booking management

### Critical Path for MVP (Phase 1)

**Priority: HIGH - Must Have for Launch**

1. Dashboard layout with navigation
2. Bookings list page with filters
3. Booking detail page with "Pay Now" integration
4. Quick stats on overview page
5. Basic empty states

**Priority: MEDIUM - Should Have Soon**

6. Profile management (name, email, phone)
7. Favorites system
8. PDF receipt generation

**Priority: LOW - Can Wait**

9. Reviews & ratings
10. Security features (password change, 2FA)
11. Trip management pages
12. Notification preferences

### Success Criteria (30 days post-launch)

- [ ] 60%+ of users visit dashboard within 7 days of booking
- [ ] 80%+ of APPROVED bookings proceed to payment via dashboard
- [ ] 30%+ of users complete profile information
- [ ] 10%+ of PAID bookings receive reviews
- [ ] <5% support tickets about booking status (down from baseline)

### Next Steps

1. ✅ Review and approve revised plan
2. Create dashboard layout mockups (Figma/design)
3. Set up database migrations (User profile fields, Favorite model)
4. Implement Phase 1 (Week 1-2):
   - Dashboard shell
   - Bookings list
   - Booking detail
5. User testing with beta group
6. Iterate based on feedback
7. Roll out Phases 2-4 incrementally
