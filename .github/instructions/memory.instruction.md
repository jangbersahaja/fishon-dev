## Current Implementation Status

### Angler Dashboard Project

**Overall Status**: Phase 2 Complete ✅

**Strategic Plan**: `docs/plan-angler-dashboard.md`

- 4 phases outlined: Core Foundation → Profile & Favorites → Reviews → Security

**Phase 1 - Core Dashboard Foundation** (COMPLETE ✅):

- Dashboard layout with sidebar navigation
- 9 account components (BookingCard, BookingStatusBadge, BookingSummary, BookingTimeline, BookingsClient, DashboardHeader, DashboardNav, EmptyState, QuickStats)
- Booking service and helpers
- Bookings list page (`/account/bookings`)
- Booking detail page (`/account/bookings/[id]`)
- API routes for bookings
- Database migration for User profile fields (name, phone, address, emergency contact)
- Layout fixes (Chrome component hides navbar/footer on dashboard pages, Navbar simplified)
- Implementation documented in `docs/feature-angler-dashboard-phase1.md`

**Phase 2 - Profile Management & Favorites** (COMPLETE ✅):

**Database Changes**:

- Added Favorite model with userId, captainCharterId, charterName, location, charterData (Json), notes, addedAt
- Unique constraint on userId + captainCharterId
- Indexes on userId and addedAt
- Migration: `20251024061327_add_favorite_model`

**Favorites System**:

- Service layer: `src/lib/services/favorite-service.ts` with getUserFavorites(), isFavorited(), addFavorite(), removeFavorite(), removeFavoriteByCharterId(), getFavoriteCount()
- FavoriteButton component: Reusable heart toggle with optimistic updates, auth checks
- API routes: GET/POST/DELETE `/api/account/favorites`
- Favorites page: Grid view with charter cards, notes, Book Now + Details buttons, empty state

**Profile Management**:

- ProfileForm component: 3 sections (Personal, Address, Emergency Contact), profile completion indicator, Malaysian state dropdown, validation
- Profile API route: POST `/api/account/profile` with field validation
- Profile page: Server component fetching user data

**Validation**: All type checks passed ✅

**Documentation**: `docs/feature-angler-dashboard-phase2.md` (complete implementation summary)

**Phase 3 - Reviews & Enhanced Features** (PLANNED):

- Review submission form (star ratings, categories, text, photos)
- PDF receipt generation for bookings
- Support contact form enhancements
- Trip management (upcoming/past views, countdown, calendar integration)

**Phase 4 - Security & Account Management** (PLANNED):

- Password change
- Two-factor authentication
- Login activity tracking
- Email notifications

### Current Next.js Structure

**Route Groups**: Using Next.js 15 App Router with route groups (see `docs/feature-app-structure-refactor.md`)

- `(auth)/` - Authentication pages (login, register, forgot-password)
- `(dashboard)/` - User dashboard with sidebar layout (`/account/*`)
- `(marketplace)/` - Public charter browsing (`/charters/*`, `/book/*`, `/search/*`)
- `(marketing)/` - Static pages (about, contact, support)

**Component Organization**: Feature-based folders

- `components/account/` - Dashboard components (11 total including FavoriteButton, ProfileForm)
- `components/charter/` - Charter detail components
- `components/charters/` - Charter list/grid components
- `components/layout/` - Navbar, Footer, Chrome
- `components/shared/` - Reusable utilities
- `components/ui/` - shadcn/ui primitives

**Lib Organization**: Service-based grouping

- `lib/api/` - API clients (captain-api, captain-db)
- `lib/auth/` - Auth utilities, NextAuth config
- `lib/database/` - Prisma clients
- `lib/services/` - Data services (charter-service, favorite-service, booking-service)
- `lib/helpers/` - Helper functions

### Active Components

**Dashboard Pages**:

- `/account/overview` - Dashboard overview with QuickStats
- `/account/bookings` - Bookings list
- `/account/bookings/[id]` - Booking detail with timeline
- `/account/favorites` - Favorites list (Phase 2)
- `/account/profile` - Profile editor (Phase 2)
- `/account/support` - Support page (placeholder)

**Reusable Components**:

- FavoriteButton - Heart toggle for favorites (can be added to charter cards anywhere)
- ProfileForm - Profile editing form with completion indicator
- BookingCard - Booking display card
- BookingStatusBadge - Status indicator for bookings
- EmptyState - Empty state placeholder with icons

### Known Working Features

**Authentication**: NextAuth with Google OAuth, session-based
**Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
**Favorites**: Add/remove charters, grid view, notes support
**Profile**: Edit personal info, address, emergency contact
**Bookings**: List view, detail view, status tracking
**Layout**: Dashboard sidebar, responsive mobile menu

### Integration Points

**With fishon-captain**:

- Shared database (via CAPTAIN_DATABASE_URL)
- Charter data via `v_public_charters` view or Public API fallback
- Booking management API

**Shared Packages**:

- `@fishon/ui` - Shared UI components and types
- `@fishon/schemas` - Shared validation schemas
- Future: `@fishon/packages` (planned consolidation)

### Testing Status

- Type checking: ✅ Passed (npm run typecheck)
- Database migrations: ✅ Applied successfully
- Prisma client: ✅ Generated with latest schema
- Manual testing: Pending user validation

### Technical Debt & Notes

**Current Limitations**:

- No photo upload for profile
- Favorites notes cannot be edited after creation
- Password change not implemented (Phase 4)
- Email verification not implemented
- Malaysia states hardcoded (no dynamic loading)

**Layout Fixes Applied**:

- Chrome component hides navbar/footer on `/account/*` routes
- Navbar simplified to static positioning
- Dashboard has full layout control

**Important Conventions**:

- Always use feature-based component organization
- Follow route groups for logical separation
- Server Components for data fetching, Client Components only where needed
- Type-safe database queries with Prisma
- Proper authentication guards on all dashboard pages

### Next Recommended Action

**Option 1**: Proceed with Phase 3 implementation (Reviews & Enhanced Features)
**Option 2**: User testing of Phase 2 features (Favorites + Profile)
**Option 3**: Address technical debt or known limitations
