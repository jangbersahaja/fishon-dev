# Prisma Schema Fixes - BlogComment Model & Newsletter Fields

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing BlogComment Model

**Error:**

```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'findMany')
at prisma.blogComment.findMany()
```

**Problem:** The `BlogComment` model was missing from the Prisma schema, even though the application code was trying to use it.

**Solution:** Added the complete `BlogComment` model to the schema.

### 2. Incorrect NewsletterSubscription Field

**Error:**

```
PrismaClientValidationError: Unknown argument `subscribedAt`. Did you mean `unsubscribedAt`?
```

**Problem:** The code was referencing a non-existent field `subscribedAt` when the actual field name is `createdAt`.

**Solution:** Updated all references from `subscribedAt` to `createdAt`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added BlogComment Model

**File:** `prisma/schema.prisma`

```prisma
model BlogComment {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  content   String
  approved  Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  authorId  String
  postId    String

  author User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  post   BlogPost @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@index([postId])
  @@index([authorId])
  @@index([approved])
}
```

**Features:**

- ✅ Links comments to users (authors)
- ✅ Links comments to blog posts
- ✅ Approval workflow (pending by default)
- ✅ Cascade delete (when user or post is deleted)
- ✅ Indexed for performance

### 2. Updated User Model

Added relation to comments:

```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  comments     BlogComment[]
}
```

### 3. Updated BlogPost Model

Added relation to comments:

```prisma
model BlogPost {
  // ... existing fields
  comments        BlogComment[]
}
```

### 4. Fixed Newsletter Page

**File:** `src/app/admin/blog/newsletter/page.tsx`

**Changed:**

- `subscribedAt` → `createdAt` (3 occurrences)

**Locations:**

1. `orderBy` clause in query
2. CSV export data
3. Table display date

## Database Sync

Used `prisma db push` to sync the schema changes to the database:

```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

**Result:** ✅ Database is now in sync with schema

## Testing

### Test BlogComment Model

1. Navigate to `/admin/blog/comments`
2. Should display the comments list without errors
3. Test approve/delete actions

### Test Newsletter Subscriptions

1. Navigate to `/admin/blog/newsletter`
2. Should display subscribers sorted by creation date
3. Test CSV export with correct dates

### Models Used By:

**BlogComment:**

- `src/app/admin/blog/comments/page.tsx` - Display all comments
- `src/app/admin/blog/comments/actions.ts` - Approve/delete/create actions
- `src/components/blog/CommentSection.tsx` - Public comment display (if exists)

**NewsletterSubscription:**

- `src/app/admin/blog/newsletter/page.tsx` - Admin newsletter management
- `src/app/api/newsletter/subscribe/route.ts` - Subscription endpoint (if exists)

## Schema Relationships

```
User (1) ──────────> (*) BlogComment
                          │
BlogPost (1) ─────────> (*) BlogComment
```

### Cascade Behavior

- When a **User** is deleted → All their comments are deleted
- When a **BlogPost** is deleted → All its comments are deleted

## Migration Notes

- No migration file created (used `db push` instead)
- Existing data preserved
- New table created: `BlogComment`
- No breaking changes to existing tables

## Next Steps

Consider adding:

1. **Comment Threading** - Reply-to functionality
2. **Comment Reactions** - Like/dislike system
3. **Spam Detection** - Integrate with Akismet or similar
4. **Email Notifications** - Notify authors of new comments
5. **Markdown Support** - Rich text in comments
6. **Comment Editing** - Allow users to edit their comments
