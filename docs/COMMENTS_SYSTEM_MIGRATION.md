# Comments System Migration: Giscus → Database-Backed Comments

## Issue

Giscus was showing an error in the browser console:

```
[giscus] An error occurred. Error message: "giscus is not installed on this repository"
```

## Root Cause

Giscus is a GitHub Discussions-based commenting system that requires:

1. GitHub App installation on the repository
2. GitHub Discussions enabled
3. Proper configuration with repository IDs

However, the Fishon project already had a complete database-backed comment system (`BlogComment` model) that was not being used.

## Solution

**Replaced Giscus with the existing database-backed comment system** that offers:

- ✅ Full control over comment moderation
- ✅ No external dependencies
- ✅ Admin approval workflow
- ✅ Better integration with the application
- ✅ No GitHub requirements

## Changes Made

### 1. Created BlogCommentSection Component

**File:** `src/components/blog/BlogCommentSection.tsx`

A complete client-side comment UI with:

- Comment display (only approved comments)
- Comment submission form
- Name and email fields
- Success/error feedback
- Responsive design matching Fishon branding

### 2. Created Comments API Endpoint

**File:** `src/app/api/blog/comments/route.ts`

Handles comment submissions:

- Validates required fields
- Validates email format
- Checks if blog post exists
- Creates or finds user by email
- Creates comment (pending approval by default)
- Returns appropriate responses

### 3. Updated Blog Service

**File:** `src/lib/blog-service.ts`

**Changes:**

- Added `BlogComment` import
- Updated `BlogPostWithRelations` type to include comments
- Modified `getBlogPostBySlug` to fetch approved comments
- Comments sorted by creation date (newest first)

### 4. Updated Blog Post Page

**File:** `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Replaced `GiscusComments` import with `BlogCommentSection`
- Fetch comments from post data
- Pass comments to new component

## Features

### For Visitors

1. **View Comments**

   - See all approved comments
   - Display commenter name
   - Show formatted dates
   - Clean, readable layout

2. **Post Comments**
   - Simple form with name, email, and message
   - Instant feedback on submission
   - Clear indication that comments require approval

### For Admins

1. **Moderation Dashboard**

   - View all comments at `/admin/blog/comments`
   - See pending vs approved status
   - Approve or delete comments
   - Track comment activity

2. **Automatic User Management**
   - Creates user accounts for commenters automatically
   - Links comments to users
   - Preserves display names

## Comment Workflow

```
1. Visitor submits comment
   ↓
2. API creates user (if new email)
   ↓
3. Comment created with approved=false
   ↓
4. Admin reviews at /admin/blog/comments
   ↓
5. Admin approves comment
   ↓
6. Comment appears on blog post
```

## API Details

### POST /api/blog/comments

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "postId": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "email": "string",
  "content": "string"
}
```

**Success Response (201):**

```json
{
  "message": "Comment submitted successfully",
  "comment": {
    "id": "string",
    "content": "string",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-15T..."
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**

- 400: Missing fields or invalid email
- 404: Blog post not found
- 500: Server error

## Database Schema

### BlogComment Model

```prisma
model BlogComment {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  content   String
  approved  Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  authorId  String
  postId    String

  author User     @relation(...)
  post   BlogPost @relation(...)

  @@index([postId, authorId, approved])
}
```

## Security Features

✅ **Email Validation** - Regex check for valid email format
✅ **Post Verification** - Ensures comment is for existing post
✅ **Approval Required** - All comments pending by default
✅ **Spam Prevention** - Manual approval prevents spam
✅ **Input Sanitization** - Form validation on client and server

## Testing

### Test Comment Submission

1. Navigate to any blog post (e.g., `/blog/top-fishing-spots-malaysia`)
2. Scroll to comments section
3. Fill in name, email, and message
4. Submit comment
5. Should see success message

### Test Comment Moderation

1. Go to `/admin/blog/comments`
2. See pending comment with yellow background
3. Click "Approve"
4. Comment status changes
5. Check blog post - comment now visible

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:

1. **Comment Threading** - Replies to comments
2. **Rich Text** - Markdown or HTML support
3. **Reactions** - Like/dislike buttons
4. **Email Notifications** - Notify authors of new comments
5. **User Profiles** - Comment history per user
6. **Comment Editing** - Allow users to edit their comments
7. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent comment spam
8. **Akismet Integration** - Automatic spam detection

## Migration Notes

- Giscus component kept in codebase but not used
- No data loss (Giscus was external anyway)
- All new comments stored in database
- Admin can still moderate all comments
- Better integration with existing auth system

## Comparison: Giscus vs Database

| Feature          | Giscus                 | Database Comments |

| Dependencies     | GitHub                 | None              |
| Data Ownership   | GitHub                 | Your database     |
| Moderation       | GitHub Discussions     | Admin dashboard   |
| Customization    | Limited                | Full control      |
| Offline Access   | No                     | Yes               |
| Cost             | Free                   | Free              |
| Integration      | External               | Native            |
