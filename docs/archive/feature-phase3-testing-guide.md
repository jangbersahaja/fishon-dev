---

## Manual Testing Procedures

### Full Review Workflow

1. ‚úÖ Create test user account
2. ‚úÖ Create test booking (or use existing PAID booking)
3. ‚úÖ Wait for trip completion (or adjust trip date in DB)
4. ‚úÖ Submit review with photos + videos
5. ‚úÖ Verify blob storage has files
6. ‚úÖ Check review appears in `/account/reviews` as "Pending"
7. ‚úÖ (Admin) Approve review via Prisma Studio or future admin panel
8. ‚úÖ Verify review appears on charter page
9. ‚úÖ Download PDF receipt
10. ‚úÖ Verify receipt details

---

## Performance Testing

### Review Display Performance

**Goal**: Ensure charter pages load quickly with reviews

**Metrics**:

- Charter page load time: < 2 seconds
- Review query time: < 500ms
- Badge frequency calculation: < 100ms

**Tools**:

- Chrome DevTools (Network, Performance tabs)
- Next.js build output (bundle analysis)

---

### PDF Generation Performance

**Goal**: Ensure receipts generate quickly

**Metrics**:

- PDF generation time: < 3 seconds
- PDF file size: 50-100KB

**Test**:

```bash
time curl -X GET http://localhost:3002/api/account/bookings/{id}/receipt \
  -H "Cookie: {auth-cookie}" \
  -o receipt.pdf
```

---

## Database Verification

### Check Review Records

```sql
-- Check review counts
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Review";

-- Check review status distribution
SELECT approved, published, COUNT(*)
FROM "Review"
GROUP BY approved, published;

-- Check reviews with media
SELECT
  id,
  "overallRating",
  ARRAY_LENGTH(badges, 1) as badge_count,
  ARRAY_LENGTH(photos, 1) as photo_count,
  ARRAY_LENGTH(videos, 1) as video_count
FROM "Review"
WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(photos, 1) > 0 OR ARRAY_LENGTH(videos, 1) > 0;
```

### Check Blob Storage

```bash
# Check Vercel Blob dashboard for:
# - review-photos/{userId}/
# - review-videos/{userId}/
# Verify file paths match database URLs
```

---

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **Admin Moderation**: No UI for admin to approve/reject reviews (use Prisma Studio)
2. **Review Editing**: Users cannot edit reviews after submission
3. **Video Normalization**: Videos not normalized (future: use fishon-video-worker)
4. **Receipt Design**: Basic design (future: add QR code for verification)

### Future Enhancements

1. **Admin Panel**: Build review moderation UI for admins
2. **Review Editing**: Allow users to edit pending reviews
3. **Video Processing**: Integrate fishon-video-worker for video normalization
4. **Receipt QR Code**: Add QR code for receipt verification
5. **Email Receipts**: Auto-send receipt after payment confirmation
6. **Batch Receipt Download**: Download receipts for multiple bookings

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Review Button Not Appearing

**Possible Causes**:

- Booking status is not PAID
- Trip not yet completed (check date + startTime + duration)
- Already reviewed (check `/account/reviews`)

**Debug**:

```bash
# Check booking status
SELECT id, status, date, "startTime", days FROM "Booking" WHERE id = '{id}';

# Check existing review
SELECT * FROM "Review" WHERE "bookingId" = '{id}';
```

---

### Issue: PDF Not Generating

**Possible Causes**:

- Booking not PAID
- User not authenticated
- TypeScript errors in ReceiptTemplate

**Debug**:

```bash
# Check server logs
npm run dev --turbopack
# Look for errors in terminal

# Check PDF route directly
curl -X GET http://localhost:3002/api/account/bookings/{id}/receipt \
  -H "Cookie: {auth-cookie}" \
  -v
```

---

### Issue: Blob Upload Failing

**Possible Causes**:

- Missing `VERCEL_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` env var
- File size exceeds limit
- Invalid file type

**Debug**:

```bash
# Check environment variable
echo $VERCEL_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN

# Check API route logs
# Look for "Error uploading media" in server logs
```
